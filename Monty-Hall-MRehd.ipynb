    "# Monty Hall\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Monty Hall problem was a TV show in which the host had a guest participant pick one of three doors in an attempt to win a car (which is behind only one of the doors). After the participant chooses the door, the host opens one of the other 2 doors and shows the guest it has nothing behind it. Then, the participant is asked whether he would like to switch doors. This simulation aims to find an answer to that question, to find out if the chances of winning the car are bigger if the participant switches the door or not. Here, we are assuming that the participant always switches doors. The scenario is played one million times and the number of wins and losses is counted. The final result is the win and loss ratios."
